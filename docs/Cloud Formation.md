Supersaturation is needed to form a cloud drop.
How can supersaturation be achieved? There are three different methods:
1. *R*adiation (isobaric)
2. *U*plift (adiabatic)
3. *M*ixing (isobaric)

#Radiative *cooling:* 
When an air parcel radiates energy (mostly in the infrared part of the spectrum) it cools down but its amount of water does't change. As the air cools down the #watersaturation is lower (amount of water an air parcel can contain before being saturated, it is function of temperature) but the amount of water is the same. When e > $e_s$ the air parcel is saturated.
#Mixing:
Assume two air parcels at different temperatures and different water vapor parcial pressure that are at the same total pressure. If these two air parcels mix the resulting #temperature and #watervaporpressure(e) will be the weighted average of each air parcel. The weighted average is determined by the number of moles (N) of each parcel

$e = \frac{N_1}{N_1 + N_2}e_1 + \frac{N_2}{N_1 + N_2}e_2$

or approximately:

$e = \frac{M_1}{M_1 + M_2}e_1 + \frac{M_2}{M_1 + M_2}e_2$

Where $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the masses of the air parcels

The blue curve represents the #Clausius-Clapeyron curve. When the air parcel is above this curve, a cloud is formed and when it is below the cloud is dissociated. 

#Uplift :
It is generally the same as #adiabatic_ascend. It can be driven by convection, by a less dense air mass overriding a more dense one, or by air flowing up and over a mountain. When one of the above mentioned situation occurs, the following happens: The water vapor mixing ratio remains the same, but #e drop as #p drops. Additionally, the temperature drops in accordance with Poisson's relation so that #e_s also drops.

if we consider the expression for relative humidity:

$RH = \frac{e}{e_s}$

Which one drops faster?, #e or #e_s ?
Well, the answer to that is that #e drops faster and the #RH will be greater to one.
