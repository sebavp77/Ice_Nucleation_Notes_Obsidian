# Results

The spectra were used in a **Mie** fitting procedure to retrieve a **lognormal representation** of the **cloud size distribution**

* There is a non-linear dependency of the linear depolarization ratio ( #depolarization_ratio) for small micrometer sized ice crystals
* For small particles and at scattering measurement angles close to 180° the component $s_{1,2} \sim 0$ leading to measurements comparable with lidar ( #lidar)
* <mark class='yello'>Large ice crystals</mark> show a broad range of $\delta_H$ values from **0,04 to 0,4** depending on the <mark class='yellow'>particle size and shape</mark> ( #particle_size )
