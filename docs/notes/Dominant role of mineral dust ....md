# **Abstract**
"Here we present global-scale measurements of dust aerosol abundance in the upper troposphere and incorporate these into a detailed cirrus-formation mode. We show that dust aerosol initiates cirrus clouds throughout the extra-tropics in all seasons and dominates cirrus formation in the Northern Hemisphere (75â€“93% of clouds seasonally)"
They also use a global transport model to explore which of Earth's deserts are the largest contributors of dust aerosol to cirrus forming regions. 

# **Introduction and content**
* Widespread high-altitude clouds composed of ice exert a net <mark class="red">#warming </mark> effect on the planet
* Lack of dust aerosol abudance measurements
* They made wide-ranging measurements of dust aerosols in the background atmosphere and investigate dust sources using global models.
* How do they assess dust's influence on cirrus clouds formation ?

* With the techniques and instruments used the can detec dust aerosol at the minute concentration
* Regarding Figure2: The comparison between measurements and simulations shows that overall, the simulations cannot represent very well the reality. In the major of cases the simulation gives worst results for higher altitudes. Nevertheless, it looks like the simulation represents well higher dust concentration episodes like the one outlined in the text.
