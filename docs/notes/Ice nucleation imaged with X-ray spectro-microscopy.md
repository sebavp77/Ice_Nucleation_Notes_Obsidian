# Results

The heterogeneous ice nucleation rate ($\omega_{het}$) scales with the <mark class='yellow'>particle surface are</mark> ( #surface_area ): $\omega_{het} = j_{het} A_p$

* The water activity ( $a_w$) has been used in the description of ice nucelation ( #Water_activity ):
The  $a_w$ **based immersion freezing model (ABIFM)** quantifies $j_{het}$ over a range of atmospherically relevant T
* They used the ABIFM model to derive  $j_{het}$ for immersion freezing
	* With this theory  $j_{het}$ is <mark>independent of the solute</mark> 
		$$
		J_{het,imm}= m_{imm}\Delta a_w(a_w,T)+C_{imm}
	$$
	It related heterogeneous ice nucleation **kinetics** directly to **thermodynamics**
