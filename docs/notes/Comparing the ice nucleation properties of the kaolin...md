# Abstract
They performed #immersion_freezing experiments using #differential_scanning_calorimetry. involving the two chemically identical, but morphologically different, kaolin minerals of #kaolinite and #halloysite.
#Kaolinite occurs in a platy morphology, while #halloysites form predominantly tubular structures.

As can be seen in the before figure, #kaolinite  has a planar morphology while #halloysite  has a tubular morphology.
<mark class='yellow'> Our results show that, on average, the halloysite samples not only exhibit a higher ice nucleation (IN) activity than the kaolinite samples but also a higher diversity in terms of freezing onset temperatures and heterogeneously frozen fraction. </mark>
* They also milled the samples, after that they observed a decrease in the onset temperature and in  the in heterogeneous frozen fraction for #halloysite , bringing its #IN_activity close to that of the #kaolinite 
* Some of the instruments used to assess the #IN_activity  were:
	* #DVS : Used to estimate #water_absorption 
	* #BET
	* #TEM : Used to qualitatively estimate structural integrity
They observed an increase in #surface_area and destruction of tubes

<mark class="mark-border red">evidence for the influence of the tubular structure of the halloysites on their IN activity </mark>

<mark class="mark-border red">We identify the OH–Al–O–Si–OH functionalized edges as being the most likely site for ice nucleation</mark>

<mark class="mark-border red">We hypothesize that the stacking of layers and the number of stacks in halloysite tubes and kaolinite platelets affect the freezing temperature, with thicker stacks having the potential to freeze water at higher temperatures</mark>

# Introduction
* In such refreeze experiments, nucleation shows non-stochastic behavior, with sudden jumps in freezing temperature from one cycle to the next
* when aqueous solutions of the protein apoferritin underwent repeated freeze–thaw cycles in a multiwell tray, the same wells tended to freeze among the first during all cycles (Cascajo-Castresana et al., 2020)
* #CNT can be used to infer the #critical_size required for a site to host an ice embryo.By applying CNT parameterizations to diverse types of INPs, Kaufmann et al. (2017) derived site areas of 10–50 nm2, assuming flat nucleation sites
* molecular simulations of ice nucleation on silver iodide surfaces showed that <mark class="green"> chemical surface properties are even more relevant than the lattice match</mark>, since only the faces exposing silver ions were found capable of templating ice (Zielke et al., 2015)
* Pedevilla et al. (2017) showed, in a molecular dynamics study, that it is not only the arrangement of #hydroxyl_groups in a particular pattern but also their #surface_density and the strength of substrate–water interaction that are relevant descriptors of IN activity
* #clay_minerals are present in the #fine_particle_fraction
* <mark class="mark-border green">Several modeling studies have shown that the hydroxylated Al surface of kaolinite is capable of growing the primary prism face of ice on top of it </mark>

     ----> They ascribed the IN activity of this surface to its lattice match to ice, together with favorable hydrogen bonding with water molecules

* However, the presence of nucleation sites is not consistent with molecular dynamics studies, which suggest that ice nucleation can occur anywhere on the hydroxylated alumina surface of kaolinite

# Methods

## Milling
* Generally, it is supposed that short grinding times result in a reduction in kaolinite particle size and an increase in #surface_area, whereas prolonged grinding causes the particles to stick one to another and decreases the surface area or may result in the amorphization of crystalline structure (Valášková et al., 2011)

# Results and Discussion

## Immersion freezing experiments of emulsified mineral dust suspensions:


## Relationship between morphology and IN activity of halloysites and kaolinites
* The pore volume distribution derived from the DVS measurements after milling shows a clear decrease in pore diameters > 10 nm, which we assign to the halloysite tubes, while the pore volume for diameters < 10 nm increases
* Interestingly, with this loss of pore volume, the IN activity of halloysites becomes similar to the one of the kaolinite samples. This shows that the tubular morphology strongly affects the IN activity
* An increase in #surface_area indeed goes along with an increase in #Fhet for the untreated samples, with CL as the only exception. Yet, this correlation is destroyed when milled samples are included, as these exhibit lower Fhet, despite increased surface areas
