The #rate of #heterogeneous nucleation per particle can be defined as:

$J = 4 \pi r^{2}_N A_r n^{*}z$

Where:
* $r_N$ is the particle radius
* $A_r$ is the particles efficience rate
* $n^{*}$ is the number of critical germ per unit area
* $z$ is the #zeldovich factor 

<mark class="blue">Interpretation of the #zeldovich  factor</mark>: Account for the depletion of embryo population due to germ production. I interpret this like there will be less embryo population as the germ growths.

> the number of critical ice germ, $n^{*}$, which are formed by #stochastic aggregation of molecules can be approximated by the #Boltzmann expression:

$n^{*} = n_1 e^{\frac{-\Delta g_g}{kt}}$

Where $n_1$ is the number of single molecules in contact with unit area of the substrate
