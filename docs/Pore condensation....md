# Abstract
An accepted pathway, known as #deposition_nucleation assumes a direct transition of water from the vapor to ice phase without an intermediate liquid phase.
However, studies have shown that <mark class="yellow"> nucleation occurs through a liquid phase in porous particles</mark> with narrow cracks or surface imperfections where the condensation of liquid below water saturation can occur, questioning the validity of deposition nucleation. In Figure 1 depictes PCF and deposition nucleation.

* Below #water_saturation pore condensation and freezing is a dominant pathway for atmospheric ice nucleation

# Introduction
* Homogeneous freezing requires #water_saturation, and it has been observed that below water saturation when the temperature is decreased lower than -38Â°C ice crystals are formed.
* #PCF is limited to the number of pore sizes large enough to accomodate a critical ice embryo and narrow enough for condensation of liquid water to occur.
* Experiments have shown that the ability of materials to nucleate ice is more efficient after beign #precooled below homogeneous nucleation temperature

# Results
* <mark class="red">3.8 nm </mark> pore diameter is enough to allow water condensation and #ice_nucleation 
* #PCF is a function of #time and residence times are required for water to freeze
* #PCF is <mark class="red">not</mark> needed to explain #ice_nucleation within an <mark class="red">immersed</mark> droplet
* Using #thermodynamics and #CNT was demonstrated that <mark class="red">surfaces that induce premelting (as #silica) cannot #heterogeneously nucleate ice from the liquid phase</mark>
* The #contribution of various desert dust to #ice_nucleation via the #PCF mechanism depends on 
	* Their transported #airbone fraction
	* the pore size distribution
